# Zuul gateway

This example demonstrates how you can use Zuul with Spring boot.


### Building

The example can be built with

    mvn clean install

### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)
- The Red Hat JDG xPaaS product should already be installed and running on your OpenShift installation, one simple way to run a JDG service is following the documentation of the JDG xPaaS image for OpenShift related to the `datagrid65-basic` template


To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the running pods, and view logs and much more.
